# GymMaster

GymMaster is a comprehensive gym management system built with Python and Tkinter. It provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for gym owners and managers to keep track of members, classes, and equipment.

## Features

1. **Member Management**
   - Add new members
   - Remove existing members
   - View all members with their details

2. **Class Management**
   - Add new classes
   - Remove existing classes
   - View all classes with their schedules

3. **Equipment Management**
   - Add new equipment
   - Remove existing equipment
   - Update equipment maintenance dates
   - View all equipment with their details

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GymMaster.git
   cd GymMaster
   ```

2. No additional package installation is required as the application uses only built-in Python libraries.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```
python gym_master.py
```

The GUI will open, presenting you with three tabs:

1. **Members**: Manage gym members here.
2. **Classes**: Add, remove, or view fitness classes.
3. **Equipment**: Keep track of gym equipment and their maintenance.

## Data Storage

The application stores data in JSON files:

- `members.json`: Stores member information
- `classes.json`: Stores class information
- `equipment.json`: Stores equipment information

These files are created automatically when you add data and are loaded when you start the application.

## Customization

You can easily customize GymMaster by modifying the `gym_master.py` file. Some possible customizations include:

- Adding new features or tabs to the dashboard
- Changing the layout or styling of the GUI
- Implementing data validation or additional error handling
- Adding reporting or data visualization features
